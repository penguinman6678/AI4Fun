# For Tic-Tae-Toe
## Game.py --  the main module to run a game
#### Update
|Date | Summary|
| ------ | ------ |
|Oct 29 2019 | game.py is based on two agent playing which will dump outputs of history of movements  |
#### Things to do
1. need to add a functionality to allow a user to select an option for 1) user vs computer; 2) computer (agent) vs computer (agent)
2. update the function from board.py to tell if a component is connected for a winning -- much smarter way
